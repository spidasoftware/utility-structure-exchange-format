JSON was chosen because of its simplicity and ubiquity.  It is very readable and can be constructed with nothing more than a text editor.  This allows for the standard to be truly platform agnostic.\r\n\r\nDesign Philosophy\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n1. Exchange file content should be human readable.\r\n1. The definition files should be as self documenting as possible.\r\n\r\nTechnical\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe actual specification can be found in the code section of this repository.  There we talk more about how to contribute and use the standard and included tools to validate your input files\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
