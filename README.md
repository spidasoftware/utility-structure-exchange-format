# Utility Structure Exchange Format
This project provides the schema definitions to enable the exchange of structure definitions among different utility companies wishing to share the information in a generic manner. 

## Overview

Currently the standard is a JSON based schema definition.  JSON was chosen because of its simplicity and ubiquitiy.  It is very reasable and can be constructured with nothing more than a text editor.  This allows for the standard to be truely platform agnostic.

### Design Philosphy

1. Exchange file content should be human readable.
1. The definition files should be as self documenting as possible.

### Concepts

1. If you are not familiar with JSON.  Try this short [tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/json/default.asp).

## How to Contribute

We will be using the "fork and pull" workflow, github has excellent [documentataion](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) on the this process of doing public collaboration.    We will be using method here.

In general any pull request will be reviewed for following criteria:

1. Constancy with the rest of the standard - Is the variable naming and structure similar to the rest of the schema?  
2. General usefulness of the feature - Is it of general use to the industry or specific to a particular vendor?
3. Documention provided - Are the relevant readme's and descriptions provided for user clarity?
4. Testing - has the appropriate test cases been provided to ensure expected behavior.
